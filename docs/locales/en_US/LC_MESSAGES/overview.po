"This project was created in a try to explain how machines can learn by "
"\"mimicking\" our learning process: by trying, failing and retrying until"
" they achieve a modest amount of knowledge to perform some kind of tasks "
"that lazy humans like you and me don't really want to do, like "
"calculating all possibilities in a game of hexapawn and playing it until "
"it gets so good at it that it's new job becomes to frustrate as many "
"humans as it can. In this documentation, I'll try to be as concise and "
"simple as I can while trying to explain you how this whole mess of python"
" code works and maybe a little background theory."
