"In this section, I'll explain more about how the AI can learn by playing "
"with you. I've used 3 types of \"learning algorithms\" in this project: "
"Inclusive, Exclusive and Both. When you open the game, you can change the"
" default algorithm and see how their graphs differ from each other. If "
"you're lazy and don't want to lose to my fearsome AI, that's okay (even I"
" am tired of losing that thing), just stick with me and you'll understand"
" the magic behind the monster."

"Remember when you was a kid and you wanted so much that bar of chocolate,"
" but your mom said: \"NO!\"? At that moment, you learned that sometimes, "
"you can't have everything you want whenever you want. That's one way we "
"lovely humans can learn, but there are another ways (just two, to be "
"honest) that are more interesting if you think like a programmer."

"The first one is the learning by reward. This kind of happens every year "
"when an entity called \"Santa Claus\" rewards children based on their "
"behaviour along the year. If you were a good boy/girl, you were rewarded "
"with a new bicycle, a brand new `Nintendo 64 "
"<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFlcqWQVVuU>`_ (pun intended), or "
"anything like that. After opening the presents under the christmas tree, "
"you learn that being a nice person can be rewarding, so you'll look "
"forward being a nice person every year."

"Keeping up with the christmas example (and spirit :D), the other way of "
"learning is based on punishment. Remember when I said that only the good "
"boys/girls won cool presents? That's right, the bad boys/girls don't get "
"anything, but their friends do. And when they go outside to play and see "
"the cool things their neighbors got by just being nice, they may be "
"tempted to change their behaviour the next year and get some presents too"
" (or they may get mad at Mr. Santa Claus, start growing green hair and "
"change their names to *Grinch*)."

"main reason for this is that hexapawn's moves are pretty simple to "

"When started, the function will simulate the game state based on the "
"given movecode using the ``self.judge`` object within the Ai class. The "
"judge will execute the given movecode and then, the algorithm will check "
"all possible capture movements for the opposing color (if the last move "
"was a white pawn move, it'll check for all possible moves for the black "
"pawns, and so on), generating a list of strings (movecodes). Then, the "
"algorithm will run the ``__make_nodes()`` function again, carrying the "
"given movecode plus one member of the children list (the list of possible"
" moves) and do all this process again and again, until it reaches a leaf "
"(a game state where someone win). In this case, it'll return a Node "
"object containing no children at all, which causes the application call "
"stack (its PROGRAM CALL STACK, not MOVE CALL STACK. They're very "
"different things) to go back one level (the process is kept open until "
"all possible trees have been solved, i.e. reached a leaf) and solve the "
"next children (sorry, I can't explain how a function that keeps calling "
"itself until some condition is met properly)."
