"*\"Hexapawn is a deterministic two-player game invented by Martin "
"Gardner. It is played on a rectangular board of variable size, for "
"example on a 3×3 board or on a chessboard. On a board of size n×m, each "
"player begins with m pawns, one for each square in the row closest to "
"them. The goal of each player is to advance one of their pawns to the "
"opposite end of the board or to prevent the other player from moving.\"*"

"and (generally) a 3x3 chessboard where your objective is to get to the "
"other side of the board OR capture all of your enemy's pawns. And yes, "
"this version was made in a way that you'll always lose (sorry for that), "
"but the fun part is understanding how simple yet amazing AIs can be."
