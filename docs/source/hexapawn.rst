What is Hexapawn?
=================

According to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapawn>`_:

*"Hexapawn is a deterministic two-player
game invented by Martin Gardner. 
It is played on a rectangular board of 
variable size, for example on a 3×3 board
or on a chessboard. 
On a board of size n×m, each player begins
with m pawns, one for each square in the 
row closest to them. The goal of each 
player is to advance one of their pawns 
to the opposite end of the board or 
to prevent the other player from moving."*

TL;DR: It's an "oversimplified" version of
chess that uses only pawns and (generally)
a 3x3 chessboard where your objective is
to get to the other side of the board OR
capture all of your enemy's pawns. And yes,
this version was made in a way that you'll
always lose (sorry for that), but the fun
part is understanding how simple yet amazing
AIs can be.
