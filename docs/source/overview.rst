Overview
********

This project was created in a try to explain 
how machines can learn by "mimicking" our
learning process: by trying, failing and
retrying until they achieve a modest amount
of knowledge to perform some kind of tasks
that lazy humans like you and me don't really
want to do, like calculating all possibilities
in a game of hexapawn and playing it until it
gets so good at it that it's new job becomes
to frustrate as many humans as it can.
In this documentation, I'll try to be as concise
and simple as I can while trying to explain you
how this whole mess of python code works and
maybe a little background theory.
